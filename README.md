## Development Environment
- Flutter
- Android Studio
- GitHub
## Flutter
Flutter is an app framework in which you can use one codebase for multiple platforms. 
A Flutter project can be deployed onto Android, IOS, or the Web. 
To accomplish this cross-platform development, Flutter runs the code natively before adjusting for the platform. 
This allows for faster testing of applications. 
Flutter also includes a feature called hot reloading which allows currently running tests to be updated within seconds.
Flutter was developed by Google
## Android Studio
While Android is in the name, Android Studio can be used to develop for flutter. 
Android Studio has many built in features for app development such as tools to run an image of a phone or using a USB directly test on a physical device. 
Android Studio is built off of intellij thus, it has built GitHub functionality making git commands incredibly easy.
## Libraries
- Sqflite: This library is used to build an SQL Database for applications. This allows devices to save data locally.
- Http: We can use this to issue http request
- Dart Libraries: Dart has many libraries that will be helpful in application development. This is the language Flutter is based on.
